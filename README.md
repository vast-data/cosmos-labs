# Orbital Dynamics: Hands-On Labs with VAST SDKs

## Welcome to Orbital Dynamics

*"Where complex systems find their orbit"*

Orbital Dynamics is a mid-sized space technology company that processes astronomical data and manages satellite constellation networks for research institutions, government agencies, and private space companies. They've recently landed a major NASA contract for real-time processing of deep space telescope data, which is pushing their infrastructure to new limits.

This series of hands-on labs follows the journey of the Orbital Dynamics team as they tackle real-world challenges using the VAST Management System and VAST Database. Through these labs, you'll learn how to use `vastpy` and `vastdb` to solve complex data management and processing problems in a space technology environment.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vast-data/cosmos-labs
   cd cosmos-labs
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies (recommended)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Or use the helper script for guided installation
   python3 install_dependencies.py
   ```

3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   # Test basic imports
   python3 lab1/test_basic_imports.py
   
   # Or test individually
   python -c "import yaml; print('pyyaml installed successfully')"
   python -c "import vastpy; print('vastpy installed successfully')"
   python -c "import vastdb; print('vastdb installed successfully')"
   ```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** with basic programming experience
- **VAST Management System cluster** access
- **Git** for version control
- **vastpy** and **vastdb** SDKs (installed via requirements.txt)

## Configuration Management

This repository uses a centralized configuration approach with **strict validation**:

- **`config.yaml.example`** - Example configuration template for all labs (non-sensitive settings)
- **`secrets.yaml.example`** - Example secrets template for all labs (sensitive information)
- **`config_loader.py`** - Centralized configuration loader with lab-specific extensions
- **`config_validator.py`** - Strict validation system that prevents dangerous default values

Each lab has its own `config_loader.py` that inherits from the centralized loader and provides lab-specific configuration methods.

### **Initial Setup**

After installing the dependencies (see Installation section above), you need to create your configuration files:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration files
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml

# Edit the files with your specific settings
# config.yaml - Update with your environment settings
# secrets.yaml - Update with your actual credentials
```

**Note:** Never commit your actual `config.yaml` or `secrets.yaml` files to version control. Only the `.example` files are tracked.

### **Strict Validation Philosophy**

**No Default Values Allowed** - This system prevents accidental use of potentially dangerous default values that could overwrite production data. All configuration values must be explicitly defined in the YAML files.

**Fail-Fast Approach** - If any required configuration is missing, the application will fail to start with clear error messages, preventing silent failures that could lead to data corruption.

## Safety System

All labs include comprehensive **dual-mode safety systems** to prevent accidental changes to production VAST systems:

- **üõ°Ô∏è Dry Run Mode (Default)** - Preview operations without making changes
- **üöÄ Production Mode** - Requires explicit confirmation (`--pushtoprod` flag)
- **üîç Comprehensive Safety Checks** - Multiple validation layers before any changes

See individual lab READMEs for detailed safety information and command-line usage.

## Utilities

- **`test_login.py`** - Test script to verify VAST VMS connectivity and authentication
- **`test_config_validation.py`** - Test script to verify configuration validation system
