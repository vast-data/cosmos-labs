# Orbital Dynamics: Hands-On Labs with VAST SDKs

## Welcome to Orbital Dynamics

*"Where complex systems find their orbit"*

Orbital Dynamics is a mid-sized space technology company that processes astronomical data and manages satellite constellation networks for research institutions, government agencies, and private space companies. They've recently landed a major NASA contract for real-time processing of deep space telescope data, which is pushing their infrastructure to new limits.

This series of hands-on labs follows the journey of the Orbital Dynamics team as they tackle real-world challenges using the VAST Management System and VAST Database. Through these labs, you'll learn how to use `vastpy` and `vastdb_sdk` to solve complex data management and processing problems in a space technology environment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these labs, you should have:

- Basic Python programming experience
- Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON
- Understanding of data processing concepts
- Access to a VAST Management System cluster
- Python 3.7+ installed

## Required Tools

- **vastpy** - Python SDK for VAST Management System (storage, views, monitoring)
- **vastdb** - Python SDK for VAST Database (metadata catalog, queries)
- **Python 3.7+** - Programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional) - For interactive development
- **Git** - For version control

## Python Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:

- **pyyaml** - YAML configuration file parsing
- **vastpy** - VAST Management System SDK (version 0.3.17+)
- **vastdb_sdk** - VAST Database SDK for metadata catalog functionality
- **astropy** - Astronomical data processing (for Lab 2)
- **h5py** - HDF5 file format support (for Lab 2)

**Note:** vastpy 0.3.17 supports basic authentication with `user`, `password`, and `address` parameters. Advanced features like `token`, `tenant_name`, and `version` are not yet supported in this version.

## Configuration Management

This repository uses a centralized configuration approach with **strict validation**:

- **`config.yaml.example`** - Example configuration template for all labs (non-sensitive settings)
- **`secrets.yaml.example`** - Example secrets template for all labs (sensitive information)
- **`config_loader.py`** - Centralized configuration loader with lab-specific extensions
- **`config_validator.py`** - Strict validation system that prevents dangerous default values

Each lab has its own `config_loader.py` that inherits from the centralized loader and provides lab-specific configuration methods.

### **Initial Setup**

Before running any labs, you need to create your configuration files:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration files
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml

# Edit the files with your specific settings
# config.yaml - Update with your environment settings
# secrets.yaml - Update with your actual credentials
```

**Note:** Never commit your actual `config.yaml` or `secrets.yaml` files to version control. Only the `.example` files are tracked.

### **Strict Validation Philosophy**

**No Default Values Allowed** - This system prevents accidental use of potentially dangerous default values that could overwrite production data. All configuration values must be explicitly defined in the YAML files.

**Fail-Fast Approach** - If any required configuration is missing, the application will fail to start with clear error messages, preventing silent failures that could lead to data corruption.

## Safety System

Both Lab 1 and Lab 2 include comprehensive **dual-mode safety systems** to prevent accidental changes to production VAST systems:

### **üõ°Ô∏è Dry Run Mode (Default)**
- **No actual changes** are made to the VAST system
- **Preview operations** before execution
- **Comprehensive safety checks** run automatically
- **Estimated results** are shown for all operations
- **Perfect for testing and validation**

### **üöÄ Production Mode**
- **Explicit confirmation** required (`--pushtoprod` flag)
- **Actual changes** made to VAST views, storage, and metadata
- **User must type 'YES'** to confirm production operations
- **All safety checks must pass** before any changes
- **Comprehensive logging** of all operations

### **üîç Safety Checks Performed**

#### **Lab 1: Storage Management Safety**
- View existence and permissions validation
- Monitoring system status verification
- Quota limits and backup status checks
- Network connectivity and system health validation
- Storage expansion impact assessment

#### **Lab 2: Metadata Catalog Safety**
- VAST system health and responsiveness
- View policy validation and conflicts
- Directory access and file count limits
- Storage impact estimation and capacity checks
- Processing capacity and backup status validation

### **üìã Command Line Usage**

```bash
# DRY RUN MODE (default - no changes)
python lab1/lab1_solution.py
python lab2/lab2_solution.py

# PRODUCTION MODE (actual changes - requires confirmation)
python lab1/lab1_solution.py --pushtoprod
python lab2/lab2_solution.py --pushtoprod

# Lab-specific operations
python lab1/lab1_solution.py --setup-only      # Only create views
python lab1/lab1_solution.py --monitor-only    # Only run monitoring
python lab2/lab2_solution.py --setup-only      # Only create schema
python lab2/lab2_solution.py --ingest-only     # Only ingest data
```

### **üí° Safety Philosophy**
- **"Look before you leap"** - Always preview operations first
- **"Fail safe"** - Better to block an operation than cause damage
- **"Explicit consent"** - Production changes require user confirmation
- **"Comprehensive validation"** - Multiple layers of safety checks
