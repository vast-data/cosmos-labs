# Lab 1: Satellite Data Infrastructure Planning

## Problem Statement

Orbital Dynamics has just secured the NASA contract for the COSMOS-7 telescope array, which will generate a staggering 50TB of raw astronomical data per day. While the team is excited about this opportunity, they recognize that success depends on having robust infrastructure in place before the first data stream arrives.

**The Challenge:** Maya Chen's infrastructure team needs to design and implement an automated storage management system that can handle the anticipated data volume before the satellite goes live. The current manual processes won't scale, and they need to ensure Jordan Blake's data processing pipeline has reliable, automated access to storage resources from day one.

## Character Interactions

### Scene 1: The Strategic Planning Meeting
*Location: Orbital Dynamics Conference Room, 9:00 AM*

**Dr. Alex Sterling (CTO):** "Team, we've got three months before COSMOS-7 goes live, and we need to be ready. NASA expects us to process their data within 24 hours of receipt, which means our infrastructure must be bulletproof from day one."

**Maya Chen (Lead SysAdmin):** "Alex, I've been analyzing our current storage management processes. We're manually provisioning storage and managing quotas, which works fine for our current 5TB daily volume. But scaling to 50TB daily means we need automation that can handle 10x our current capacity."

**Jordan Blake (Senior Developer):** "I'm concerned about pipeline reliability. My current processing workflow assumes storage will always be available, but with this volume, we need proactive monitoring and automatic scaling. I can't afford to have my pipeline fail mid-analysis because we hit storage limits."

**Sam Rodriguez (DevOps Engineer):** "I've been researching the VAST Management System API. We can use `vastpy` to build automated storage provisioning that scales with our data growth. The key is implementing predictive scaling based on data ingestion patterns."

**Mac Thompson (Junior Admin):** "So instead of waiting for problems to happen, we're building the solution before we need it?"

**Maya:** "Exactly, Mac. We're planning for success, not reacting to failure."

### Scene 2: The Technical Architecture Session
*Location: Maya's Office, 2:00 PM*

**Maya:** "Sam, walk us through the technical approach. We need to understand how this automation will work."

**Sam:** "The `vastpy` SDK gives us programmatic control over the entire VAST Management System. We can create views, manage quotas, and monitor usage patterns in real-time. The beauty of VAST is that we don't need to worry about storage tiers - all our data gets the same high performance regardless of age or access patterns."

**Jordan:** "I need to understand how this integrates with my pipeline. Can we build monitoring that tells us in advance when we're approaching capacity limits?"

**Sam:** "Absolutely. We can implement predictive scaling that monitors data ingestion rates and automatically provisions additional storage before we hit critical thresholds. The system will learn from usage patterns and scale proactively."

**Mac:** "What about failure scenarios? What happens if the automation fails?"

**Maya:** "Great question. We'll build in redundancy and fallback mechanisms. The goal is to never need them, but we'll have them ready."

## Technical Challenge Overview

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Design Proactive Storage Architecture** - Plan and implement automated storage management that scales with anticipated data growth
2. **Implement Predictive Scaling** - Build systems that anticipate storage needs based on data ingestion patterns
3. **Create Comprehensive Monitoring** - Develop real-time visibility into storage utilization and automated provisioning status
4. **Build Resilient Pipeline Integration** - Ensure Jordan's data processing workflows have reliable, automated access to storage resources

### Key Technical Components:

#### 1. VAST Management System Integration
- Initialize `vastpy` client with proper authentication
- Design automated view management for different data types:
  - **Raw data views:** Incoming telescope data from COSMOS-7
  - **Processed data views:** Transformed and analyzed results
  - **Temporary views:** Intermediate processing stages
- Implement intelligent quota policies that scale with data volume
- Leverage VAST's unified storage architecture - no need to manage separate hot/warm/cold tiers

#### 2. Predictive Storage Pool Management
- Design monitoring systems that track data ingestion patterns
- Implement automated storage provisioning when utilization approaches 75%
- Build predictive models that anticipate storage needs based on historical patterns
- Leverage VAST's unified storage architecture for consistent performance

#### 3. Proactive Monitoring and Alerting
- Develop real-time monitoring scripts using `vastpy`'s capabilities
- Create early warning systems for:
  - Storage utilization approaching limits
  - Quota allocation needs
  - Processing pipeline resource requirements
- Integrate with existing notification systems for proactive alerts

#### 4. Pipeline Integration and Resilience
- Design Jordan's processing pipeline to:
  - Monitor available space in processed data buckets before starting transformations
  - Request storage resources programmatically when approaching limits
  - Implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Create comprehensive status reporting for storage availability across all pipeline stages
- Build intelligent quota management that scales with processing workload

## Success Criteria

1. **Proactive Infrastructure** - Storage provisioning happens automatically before it's needed
2. **Predictive Scaling** - System anticipates storage needs based on data ingestion patterns
3. **Pipeline Reliability** - Jordan's processing pipeline has guaranteed access to storage resources
4. **Real-time Visibility** - Maya's team has complete visibility into storage utilization and provisioning status
5. **NASA SLA Readiness** - Infrastructure ready to meet all data processing deadlines from day one

## Business Impact

- **Ensure Mission Success** - Infrastructure ready to handle COSMOS-7 data volume from launch
- **Improve Efficiency** - Maya's team can focus on strategic infrastructure planning instead of reactive fixes
- **Build NASA Confidence** - Demonstrate capability to handle large-scale data processing requirements
- **Scale for Growth** - System designed to handle increased data volumes as more satellites come online

## Implementation Timeline

The team will implement this automation in phases to ensure readiness before COSMOS-7 launch:
1. **Month 1:** Core storage monitoring and basic automation
2. **Month 2:** Predictive scaling and quota management
3. **Month 3:** Full pipeline integration and testing
4. **Launch Week:** Final validation and go-live support

## Risk Mitigation

- **Redundancy Planning** - Multiple automation paths to prevent single points of failure
- **Fallback Mechanisms** - Manual override capabilities for emergency situations
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Load testing with simulated data volumes before launch
- **Documentation** - Complete operational procedures for the new automated systems
