# Lab 3: Weather Data Pipeline and Analytics

## Problem Statement

With NASA's contract requiring real-time processing of deep space telescope data, Orbital Dynamics needs to expand their data analytics capabilities beyond astronomical observations. The company has been approached by environmental agencies and health organizations to provide weather data analytics for air quality monitoring and health risk assessment.

**The Challenge:** Build a comprehensive weather data pipeline that can ingest, store, and analyze large-scale weather and air quality datasets while providing real-time insights for health impact assessment and environmental monitoring.

## Character Interactions

### Scene 1: The Weather Data Opportunity
*Location: Conference Room, 2:00 PM*

**Dr. Alex Sterling (CTO):** "We've been approached by the Environmental Protection Agency and several health organizations. They need a system that can process weather and air quality data at scale, with real-time analytics for health risk assessment. This could be a significant new revenue stream."

**Maya Chen (Lead SysAdmin):** "Our current infrastructure handles astronomical data well, but weather data has different characteristics - it's more frequent, has different access patterns, and requires real-time correlation analysis. We need to adapt our approach."

**Jordan Blake (Senior Developer):** "I've been looking at weather APIs and air quality data sources. The data volume is massive - hourly updates for thousands of cities worldwide, with multiple parameters per measurement. Our current storage approach won't scale."

**Sam Rodriguez (DevOps Engineer):** "We can leverage our existing `vastdb` infrastructure for the analytics, but we need a robust data ingestion pipeline. Weather data comes from multiple APIs with different rate limits and formats."

### Scene 2: Weather Data Pipeline Architecture
*Location: Sam's Workspace, 4:00 PM*

**Sam:** "Here's my proposal: we build a unified weather data pipeline that can handle multiple data sources and provide real-time analytics. We use `vastdb` for storage and analytics, with intelligent data ingestion that respects API rate limits."

**Jordan:** "How do we handle the different data formats and API requirements without creating a maintenance nightmare?"

**Sam:** "We create a modular ingestion system that can handle different APIs and data formats. Weather data gets standardized and stored in `vastdb` for fast analytics. We can correlate weather patterns with air quality metrics to identify health risks."

**Mac Thompson (Junior Admin):** "So instead of just storing data, we're building a system that can actually predict health risks from weather and air quality patterns?"

**Sam:** "Exactly. We can identify dangerous pollution episodes, correlate weather patterns with air quality, and provide real-time alerts for vulnerable populations. It's like our astronomical burst detection, but for environmental health."

### Scene 3: Implementation Strategy
*Location: Dr. Sterling's Office, 10:00 AM*

**Dr. Sterling:** "This is perfect. We can demonstrate our data processing capabilities with weather data, then apply the same principles to our astronomical data. It shows we can handle diverse data types at scale."

**Sam:** "We can start with a few key cities and expand gradually. The system will be designed to handle global data, but we can validate with a manageable dataset first."

**Maya:** "And we can use the weather data to test our analytics capabilities. That way we're ready when we need to process even larger astronomical datasets, and we can show our clients our real-time analytics capabilities."
