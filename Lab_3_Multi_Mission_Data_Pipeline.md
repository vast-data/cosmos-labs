# Lab 3: Multi-Observatory Data Storage and Analytics

## Problem Statement

With SWIFT successfully operational and NASA's Chandra observatory frequently observing the same astronomical objects, Orbital Dynamics faces a data management challenge. The current approach won't handle the massive scale of data from both observatories while enabling fast, selective queries and cross-observatory analysis.

**The Challenge:** NASA wants Orbital Dynamics to build a unified storage and analytics platform that can handle both observatory datasets while supporting fast, precise insights for real-time burst detection and multi-wavelength analysis.

## Character Interactions

### Scene 1: The Data Scale Challenge
*Location: Conference Room, 2:00 PM*

**Sam Rodriguez (DevOps Engineer):** "NASA's Chandra observatory is requesting more joint observations with SWIFT, and they're expecting real-time burst detection and cross-observatory analysis. Our current storage approach won't handle the massive scale of data from both observatories."

**Jordan Blake (Senior Developer):** "I'm already spending 60% of my time managing SWIFT data storage and queries. Adding Chandra data with different access patterns and query requirements will be impossible to manage manually."

**Dr. Alex Sterling (CTO):** "NASA needs fast, selective queries across both observatory datasets. We can't afford slow queries when they're looking for specific astronomical events. We need a system that can handle exabyte-scale data while delivering instant insights."

**Maya Chen (Lead SysAdmin):** "I've been researching how we can combine `vastpy` for storage orchestration with `vastdb` for analytics. This could give us the unified platform NASA is looking for."

### Scene 2: Storage and Analytics Architecture
*Location: Sam's Workspace, 4:00 PM*

**Sam:** "Here's my proposal: we build a unified platform with different access patterns for each observatory. Same underlying infrastructure, optimized for different query patterns."

**Jordan:** "How do we handle the different data access patterns and query requirements without creating a performance nightmare?"

**Sam:** "We use `vastpy` to manage storage views optimized for different access patterns. SWIFT data gets optimized for real-time burst queries, Chandra data gets optimized for deep analysis queries, but they all use the same storage platform. The data gets stored in `vastdb` for fast, selective queries and cross-observatory analytics."

**Mac Thompson (Junior Admin):** "So instead of me manually managing two different storage systems, we have one platform that handles both SWIFT and Chandra data efficiently?"

**Sam:** "Exactly. And when NASA needs to find specific astronomical events across both observatories, they can run fast, selective queries that find the needle in the haystack. We get exabyte-scale storage with instant insights, and NASA gets the performance they need for real-time analysis."

### Scene 3: Implementation Strategy
*Location: Dr. Sterling's Office, 10:00 AM*

**Dr. Sterling:** "This is exactly what we need. NASA is already asking about our cross-observatory analytics capabilities. We need to demonstrate this before they increase the joint observation requests."

**Sam:** "We can build this incrementally. Start with SWIFT data storage and analytics, then ingest Chandra data one step at a time. That way we're ready when NASA needs us, and we can validate each step."

**Maya:** "And we can use the existing SWIFT data to test the new storage and analytics platform. That way we're ready when we ingest the Chandra data, and we can show NASA our cross-observatory query capabilities."
