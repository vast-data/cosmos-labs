# VAST SDK Workshop Participant Guide

## üéØ Welcome to the Workshop!

This guide will help you follow along during the 2-hour VAST SDK workshop. Keep this open and follow the step-by-step instructions as we explore VAST Data's Python SDKs together.

## üìã Pre-Workshop Checklist

Before we start, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Python 3.7+** installed on your laptop
- [ ] **Terminal/command line** access
- [ ] **Code editor** (VS Code, PyCharm, or similar)
- [ ] **Internet connection** for documentation
- [ ] **VAST cluster access** (read-only credentials provided)

## üöÄ Quick Setup

**Quick start:**
1. Clone repository and install dependencies according to the [Main README](../README.md).
2. Configure VAST access in `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml`
3. Test connection with `python examples/01_connect_to_vast.py`

**Expected output:** You should see cluster information and capacity metrics. If you see connection errors, check your configuration files.

## üìö Part 1: VAST SDK Fundamentals

### **Connection Test**

**Run this command:**
```bash
cd examples
python 01_connect_to_vast.py
```

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ Connection successful message
- üìä Cluster information (ID, name, GUID)
- üíæ Capacity metrics (physical, usable, logical space)
- üìà Data reduction ratio

**If you see errors:**
- Check your `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` files
- Verify network connectivity to VAST cluster
- Ensure credentials are correct

### **Configuration Understanding**

**Open your `config.yaml` file and look for:**
```yaml
vast:
  address: "https://your-vast-cluster.com"
  user: "your-username"
  ssl_verify: true
  timeout: 30
```

**Open your `secrets.yaml` file and look for:**
```yaml
vast_password: "your-password"
s3_access_key: "your-s3-access-key"
s3_secret_key: "your-s3-secret-key"
```

**Key points:**
- `config.yaml` contains non-sensitive settings
- `secrets.yaml` contains sensitive data like passwords
- Never commit `secrets.yaml` to version control
- Use environment variables for production secrets

## üéØ Key Learning Points

### **Connection Patterns**
```python
# Standard connection pattern
from vastpy import VASTClient

client = VASTClient(
    user=config.get('vast.user'),
    password=config.get_secret('vast_password'),
    address=config.get('vast.address')
)
```

### **Error Handling**
```python
try:
    result = client.views.get()
    if not result:
        print("No data found")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Handle gracefully
```

### **Safety Practices**
- Always use dry-run mode for testing
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Validate before making changes
- Monitor proactively

### **Common Operations**
- **List views:** `client.views.get()`
- **Check quotas:** `client.quotas.get()`
- **Monitor health:** `client.clusters.get()`
- **Database queries:** `vastdb.connect()`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
- Verify `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` exist
- Check VAST cluster is accessible
- Ensure credentials are correct
- Try `ssl_verify: false` for testing

### **Import Errors**
- Make sure you're in the right directory
- Verify `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed
- Check Python path includes the root directory

### **No Data Found**
- Some examples may show "No data found" in empty systems
- This is normal for new or test environments
- Examples still demonstrate the API calls

### **Database Connection Issues**
- Check endpoint points to database VIP (not VMS)
- Verify S3 credentials are correct
- Try `ssl_verify: false` for testing
- Contact VAST administrator for correct endpoint
